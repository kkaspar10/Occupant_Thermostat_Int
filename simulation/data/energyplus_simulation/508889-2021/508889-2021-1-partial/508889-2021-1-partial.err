   ** Warning ** Timestep: Requested number (1) is less than the suggested minimum of 4.
   **   ~~~   ** Please see entry for Timestep in Input/Output Reference for discussion of considerations.
   ** Warning ** RunPeriod: object=RUN PERIOD 1, start weekday (MONDAY) does not match the start year (2021), corrected to FRIDAY.
   ** Warning ** Weather file location will be used rather than entered (IDF) Location object.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Location object=BURLINGTON INTERNATIONAL AP_VT_USA
   **   ~~~   ** ..Weather File Location=045d47N-073d75W - - NASA/POWER WMO#=-
   **   ~~~   ** ..due to location differences, Latitude difference=[1.00] degrees, Longitude difference=[0.60] degrees.

   ** Warning ** For Schedule:File="CLOTHES_DRYER_EXHAUST", Blank Schedule Type Limits Name input -- will not be validated.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: Entered Zone Floor Areas differ from calculated Zone Floor Area(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Severe  ** For zone: UNFINISHED ATTIC ZONE it is not possible to calculate the volume from the surrounding surfaces so either provide the volume value or define all the surfaces to fully enclose the zone.
   ** Warning ** Indicated Zone Volume <= 0.0 for Zone=UNFINISHED ATTIC ZONE
   **   ~~~   ** The calculated Zone Volume was=0.00
   **   ~~~   ** The simulation will continue with the Zone Volume set to 10.0 m3. 
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: 1 zone is not fully enclosed. For more details use:  Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtrawarnings; 
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 1 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 1 surfaces which are receiving surfaces and are non-convex.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Shadowing values may be inaccurate. Check .shd report file for more surface shading details
   **   ~~~   ** ...Add Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to see individual warnings for each surface.
   ** Severe  ** DetermineShadowingCombinations: There are 1 surfaces which are casting surfaces and are non-convex.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Shadowing values may be inaccurate. Check .shd report file for more surface shading details
   **   ~~~   ** ...Add Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to see individual severes for each surface.
   ** Warning ** DeterminePolygonOverlap: Too many figures [>200]  detected in an overlap calculation. Use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; for more details.
   ** Warning ** The Standard Ratings is calculated for Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed = RES AC COOLING COIL but not at the AHRI test condition due to curve out of bound.
   **   ~~~   **  Review the Standard Ratings calculations in the Engineering Reference for this coil type. Also, use Output:Diagnostics, DisplayExtraWarnings for further guidance.
   ** Warning ** Check input. Pump nominal power or motor efficiency is set to 0, for pump=PUMP VARIABLE SPEED 1
